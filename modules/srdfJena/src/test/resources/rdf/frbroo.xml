FRBRoo v2.4  DRAFT  harmonised with CIDOC CRM v6.2.1 encoded in RDFS
A formal ontology intended to capture and represent the underlying semantics of bibliographic information 
and to facilitate the integration, mediation, and interchange of bibliographic and museum information. 

International Working Group on FRBR/CIDOC CRM Harmonisation
affiliated to the IFLA FRBR Review Group and the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group (CRM-SIG)

Created by ICS-FORTH (ISL-ICS) Thursday 16 June 2016

Encoding Rules:
1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.
   The blank between the concept identifier and concept name is replaced by underscores.
   For instance "F3_Manifestation_Product_Type" or "R1_is_logical_successor_of".

2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.
   Therefore, each FRBRoo property is represented as two RDFS properties.
   For instance "R1 is logical successor of (has successor)" is represented as:
   "R1_is_logical_successor_of" for the domain to range direction and "R1i_has_successor" for the range to domain direction.

3. Scope notes are represented as <rdf:comment> elements.
   
4. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding 
to the authoritative definition of the FRBRoo v2.4 (November 2015) are not intended transfer errors. 
FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F1_Work">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Work</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises distinct concepts or combinations of concepts identified in artistic and intellectual expressions, such as poems, stories or musical compositions. Such concepts may appear in the course of the coherent evolution of an original idea into one or more expressions that are dominated by the original idea. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time. The substance of Work is ideas. A Work may have members that are works in their own right.
A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists of alternative members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works. 
A Work is the product of an intellectual process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere, and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume that a work starts with a complete concept. In some cases, it can be very difficult or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at a particular time. The objective evidence for such a notion can only be based on a stage of expressions at a given time. In this sense, the sets of ideas that constitute  particular self-contained expressions may be regarded as a kind of “snap-shot” of a work.
A Work may include the concept of aggregating expressions of other works into a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F2_Expression">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Expression</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises the intellectual or artistic realisations of works in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as texts, poems, jokes, musical or choreographic notations, movement pattern, sound pattern, images, multimedia objects, or any combination of such forms that have objectively recognisable structures. The substance of F2 Expression is signs.
Expressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory.
Inasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users.
The genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work, features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image.
An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.
If an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM. Thereby one can make use of the more specific properties of these classes, such as language (which is applicable to instances of E33 Linguistic Object only).

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F3_Manifestation_Product_Type">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Manifestation Product Type</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises the definitions of publication products.
An instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type is the “species”, and all copies of a given object are “specimens” of it. An instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type defines all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item normally display in order that they may be recognised as copies of a particular publication. However, due to production problems or subsequent events, one or more instances of F5 Item may not exhibit all these features or traits; yet such instances still retain their relationship to the same instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type.
The features that characterise a given instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type include: one instance of F24 Publication Expression, containing one or more than one instance of F2 Expression, reflecting the authors’ content of the manifestation and all additional input by the publisher; and the appropriate types of physical features for that form of the object. For example, hardcover and paperback are two distinct publications (i.e. two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation Product Type) even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications. The activity of cataloguing aims at the most accurate listing of features or traits of an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type that are sufficient to distinguish it from another instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type.

It should be noted that if all but one copy of a given publication are destroyed, then that copy does not become an instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton, because it was produced together with sibling copies, even though it now happens to be unique. Examples of instances of F4 Manifestation Singleton include manuscripts, preparatory sketches and the final clean draft sent by an author or a composer to a publisher.

	<rdfs:comment>An abstract notion or idea. [FRBRER] Includes fields of knowledge, disciplines, schools of thought (philosophies, religions, political ideologies, etc.), etc. Includes theories, processes, techniques, practices, etc. [Definition from the FRAD model, unchanged]
This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation or historical implication. The production of such information may have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.
Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.
They cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost. [Scope note for E28 Conceptual Object in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F8_Event">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Event</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.
It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.
Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the ‘Neolithic Period’, the ‘Ming Dynasty’ or the ‘McCarthy Era’. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.
There are two different conceptualisations of “artistic style”, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, Impressionism can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.
[This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]
[Note that in CIDOC CRM, E12 Production, E13 Attribute Assignment, and E65 Creation are indirect subclasses of E4 Period = F8 Event; as a consequence, F8 Event is an indirect superclass of: F27 Work Conception, F28 Expression Creation, F40 Identifier Assignment, F41 Representative Manifestation Assignment, F42 Representative Expression Assignment, F32 Carrier Production Event, F33 Reproduction Event, and F30 Publication Event]

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F9_Place">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Place</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the Earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of immobile objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a section of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination. [Scope Note for E53 Place in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]
Note that Places may be determined by the location of historical or contemporary objects, geographic features, events or geo-political units.

In a bibliographic context, a name presented following the conventions usually employed for personal names will be assumed to correspond to an actual real person (F10 Person), unless evidence is available to indicate that this is not the case. The fact that a persona may erroneously be classified as an instance of F10 Person does not imply that the concept comprises personae

To be considered an F11 Corporate Body a gathering of people needs to bear a name and exhibit organisational characteristics sufficient to allow the body as a whole to participate in the creation, modification or production of an E73 Information Object. Groups such as conferences, congresses, expeditions, exhibitions, festivals, fairs, etc. are modelled as F11 Corporate Bodies when they are named and can take collective action, such as approving a report or publishing their proceedings.

The scripts or type sets for the types of symbols used to compose an instance of F12 Nomen have to be explicitly specified. The identity of an instance of F12 Nomen is given by the order of its symbols and their individual role with respect to their scripts, regardless of the semantics of the larger structural components it may be built from. Structural tags occurring in the nomen string are regarded as symbols constituting the nomen. Spelling variants are regarded as different nomina, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not change the identity.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises works that are realised by one and only one self-contained expression, i.e., works representing the concept as expressed by precisely this expression.
Inherent to the notion of work is the completion of recognisable outcomes of the work. These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard the corresponding expression as equivalent to one Individual Work.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F15_Complex_Work">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Complex Work</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to, derivatives of, or self-contained components of other members of the same Complex Work.
In practice, no clear line can be drawn between parallel and subsequent processes in the evolution of a work. One part may not be finished when another is already revised. An initially monolithic work may be taken up and evolve in pieces. The member relationship of Work is based on the conceptual relationship, and should not be confused with the internal structural parts of an individual expression. The fact that an expression may contain parts from other work(s) does not make the expressed work complex. For instance, an anthology for which only one version exists is not a complex work.
The boundaries of a Complex Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept. Thus, derivations such as translations are regarded as belonging to the same Complex Work, even though in addition they constitute an Individual Work themselves. In contrast, a Work that significantly takes up and merges concepts of other works so that it is no longer dominated by the initial concept is regarded as a new work. In cataloguing practice, detailed rules are established prescribing which kinds of derivation should be regarded as crossing the boundaries of a complex work. Adaptation and derivation graphs allow the recognition of distinct sub-units, i.e. a complex work contained in a larger complex work.
As a Complex Work can be taken up by any creator who acquires the spirit of its concept, it is never finished in an absolute sense.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F16_Container_Work">

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises works whose essence is to enhance or add value to expressions from one or more other works without altering them, by the selection, arrangement and/or addition of features of different form, such as layout to words, recitation and movement to texts, performance to musical scores etc. This does not make the contents of the incorporated expressions part of the Container Work, but only part of the resulting expression. Container Work may include the addition of new, original parts to the incorporated expressions, such as introductions, graphics, etc.
This class is an “abstract class,” in that it only serves as an umbrella for its three subclasses. As a consequence, it can only be instantiated by instances of any of its subclasses: nothing can be an instance of it, unless it is an instance of either F17 Aggregation Work, F19 Publication Work, or F20 Performance Work.
A new version of a container work does not make the resulting complex work a Container Work as well. The inclusion of expressions from a complex work in a Container Work does not make the Container Work itself complex.

This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only part of the resulting expression. F17 Aggregation Work may include additional original parts.
An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process.
A new version of an aggregate work does not make the resulting complex work an aggregate work as well. The inclusion of expressions from a complex work in an aggregation work does not make the aggregation work itself complex.

Whereas a work can acquire new members during the time it evolves, Expressions and Manifestations are identified with a certain state achieved at a particular point in time. Therefore there is in general no single Expression or Manifestation representing a complete serial work, unless the serial work has ended.
Serial Works may or may not have a plan for an overall expression.
The retrospective reprinting of all issues of a Serial Work at once, in the form of a monograph, is regarded to be another member of a Complex Work, which contains the Serial Work and the Individual Work realised in the monograph. This does not make the monograph part of the Serial Work.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises the sets of concepts for rendering a particular or a series of like performances.
F20 Performance Work is declared as a subclass of F16 Container Work. This implies that the incorporated expressions (such as the text of the staged play, the text of the argument for the ballet, the recorded music to be used for the ballet, or the content of the musical score to be used for a concert, etc.) are not by themselves a part of the expression of this F1 Work. Rather, an expression (F25 Performance Plan) of the instructions the stage production, choreography or musical performance consists of incorporates (P165) that textual or musical content. In other words, the text of ‘Hamlet’ is not a component of the concepts that underlie a given mise-en-scène of ‘Hamlet’, but any staging directions (F25 Performance Plan) that convey a given director’s vision of ‘Hamlet’ must necessarily incorporate the text of ‘Hamlet’.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises works that conceptualise the capturing of features of perdurants. The characteristics of the manifestation of a recording work are those of the product of the capture process. The characteristics of any other works recorded are distinct from those of the recording work itself. In the case where the recorded perdurant expresses some Work, the respective instance of F21 is also an F16 Container Work.
The concept of recording is not necessarily linked to the use of modern devices that allow for mechanical recording, such as tape recorders or cameras. However, in practice, library catalogues tend to regard as recordings only the products of such mechanical devices.
But the concept of recording is very much linked to the notion that there is something that is recorded. In general, photographs or animated images are not to be regarded as instances of F21 Recording Work just because of the use of the medium, but simply as instances of F1 Work (or F15 Complex Work). Only such photographs and animated images that can be used as documentation are to be regarded as recordings.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F22_Self-Contained_Expression">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Self-Contained Expression</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises the immaterial realisations of individual works at a particular time that are regarded as a complete whole. The quality of wholeness reflects the intention of its creator that this expression should convey the concept of the work. Such a whole can in turn be part of a larger whole.
Inherent to the notion of work is the completion of recognisable outcomes of the work. These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. A Self-Contained Expression may contain expressions or parts of expressions from other work, such as citations or items collected in anthologies. Even though they are incorporated in the Self-Contained Expression, they are not regarded as becoming members of the expressed container work by their inclusion in the expression, but are rather regarded as foreign or referred to elements.
F22 Self-Contained Expression can be distinguished from F23 Expression Fragment in that an F23 Expression Fragment was not intended by its creator to make sense by itself. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard an expression as self-contained.

	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Expression Fragment</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises parts of Expressions and these parts are not Self-Contained Expressions themselves.
The existence of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment can be due to accident, such as loss of material over time, e.g. the only remaining manuscript of an antique text being partially eaten by worms, or due to deliberate isolation, such as excerpts taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts.
An F23 Expression Fragment is only identified with respect to its occurrence in a known or assumed whole. The size of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment ranges from more than 99% of an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression to tiny bits (a few words from a text, one bar from a musical composition, one detail from a still image, a two-second clip from a movie, etc.).

As such, an instance of Publication Expression incorporates all Expressions combined for the resulting final form of rendering, whether visual, audio or tactile. An instance of Publication Expression is one entity regardless of the number of independent Expressions published within it, as long as it represents one unit of release.

	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Performance Plan</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises sets of directions to which individual performances of theatrical, choreographic, or musical works and their combinations should conform.
In the case of theatrical performances, such directions incorporate, but are not limited nor reducible to, the text of a given version of the play performed (e.g., a translated text, some passages of which are deliberately omitted, with some rephrased lines, etc.).
In the case of choreographic performances, such directions may incorporate, but are neither limited nor reducible to, the notation of choreographic movements in systems such as labanotation.
In the case of musical performances, such directions may incorporate, but are neither limited nor reducible to, the musical score. In case of electronic music, they may incorporate software instructions.
These directions may or may not completely determine the form of the intended performance. Depending on the nature of the directions, the form of the intended performance, such as the sets of movements or the sound characteristics, may or may not be predictable from the directions.
Note that a performance plan may be more or less elaborate, and may even foresee just improvisation.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F27_Work_Conception">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Work Conception</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises beginnings of evolutions of works.
An instance of F27 Work Conception marks the initiation of the creation of a work. The work, as an intellectual construction, evolves from this point on, until the last known expression of it. The instance of E39 Actor with which a work is associated through the chain of properties F1 Work R16i was initiated by F27 Work Conception P14 carried out by E39 Actor corresponds to the notion of the “creator” of the work. In the case of commissioned works, it is not the commissioning that is regarded as the work conception, but the acceptance of the commission.
This event does not always correlate with the date assigned in common library practice to the work, which is usually a later event (such as the date of completion of the first clean draft).
In addition, F27 Work Conception can serve to document the circumstances that surrounded the appearance of the original idea for a work, when these are known.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F28_Expression_Creation">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Expression Creation</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities that result in instances of F2 Expression coming into existence. This class characterises the externalisation of an Individual Work.
Although F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton; F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the carrying E18 Physical Thing. The work becomes manifest by being expressed on a physical carrier different from the creator’s brain. The spatio-temporal circumstances under which the expression is created are necessarily the same spatio-temporal circumstances under which the first instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton is produced. The mechanisms through which oral tradition (of myths, tales, music, etc.) operates are not further investigated in this model. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only those instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and the auditor’s brain are taken into account (for a discussion of the modelling of oral traditions, see: Nicolas, Yann. ‘Folklore Requirements for Bibliographic Records: oral traditions and FRBR.’ In: Cataloging Classification Quarterly (2005). Vol. 39, No. 3-4. P. 179-195).
It is possible to use the P2 has type (is type of) property in order to specify that the creation of a given expression of a given work played a particular role with regard to the overall bibliographic history of that work (e.g., that it was the creation of the progenitor expression on which all other expressions of the same work are based; or that it was the creation of the critical edition that served as the basis for canonical references to the work).

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises the activities of publishing. Such an event includes the creation of an F24 Publication Expression and setting up the means of production. The end of this event is regarded as the date of publication, regardless of whether the carrier production is started. Publishing can be either physical or electronic. Electronic publishing is regarded as making an instance of F24 Publication Expression available in electronic form on a public network. Electronic Publishing does not mean producing a physical instance of F5 Item by partially electronic means. Making an electronic file available on a physical carrier can be regarded as equivalent to setting up the means of production; downloading the file is regarded as the electronic equivalent of F32 Carrier Production Event.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities that follow the directions of a performance plan, such as a theatrical play, an expression of a choreographic work or a musical work; i.e., they are intended to communicate directly or indirectly to an audience.
Such activities can be identified at various levels of granularity, and can be contiguous or not. Any individual performance (with or without intermissions) is a single instance of F31 Performance. In addition, a complete run of performances can also be seen as an instance of F31 Performance, with individual performances as parts. A complete run of performances may comprise an original run plus any of its extensions and tours.
Note that a performance plan may be more or less elaborate, and may even foresee just improvisation.

	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Carrier Production Event</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities that result in instances of F54 Utilised Information Carrier coming into existence. Both the production of a series of physical objects (printed books, scores, CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMS, etc.) and the creation of a new copy of a file on an electronic carrier are regarded as instances of F32 Carrier Production Event.
Typically, the production of copies of a publication (no matter whether it is a book, a sound recording, a DVD, a cartographic resource, etc.) strives to produce items all as similar as possible to a prototype that displays all the features that all the copies of the publication should also display, which is reflected in property R27 used as source material F24 Publication Expression.

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="F33_Reproduction_Event">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Reproduction Event</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities that consist in making copies, more or less mechanically, of an instance of E84 Information Carrier (such as an F5 Item or an F4 Manifestation Singleton which is also instance of E84 Information Carrier), preserving the expression carried by it. A Reproduction Event results in new instances of E84 Information Carrier coming into existence. In general, the copy will have different attributes from the original and they are therefore not regarded as siblings.
This class makes it possible to account for the legal distinction between private copying for the purpose of “fair use,” and mass production for the purpose of dissemination.
It can prove difficult to determine where to draw the line between F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event in cases where multiple copies are produced. In this case, the copies, but not the original, may be regarded as instances of F5 Item. It is the existence of an explicit production plan that makes the difference. As a consequence, F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event are not declared as disjoint, which makes it possible to account for such situations that could be regarded as instances of both Production Event and Reproduction Event.

An F40 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents. Explicit reference to the used constituents can be made using the property P142 used constituent (was used in). The syntax of the identifier and the kinds of constituents to be used in constructing it may be declared in a rule. The construction of controlled access points for the names of persons, families and corporate bodies following specific cataloguing rules is a typical library application of identifier assignment. F40 Identifier Assignment also includes the assignment of controlled access points for works or expressions.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities through which an Agency declares (implicitly or explicitly) that a given instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type or F4 Manifestation Singleton is representative for a given F2 Expression, i.e., that some features found on that instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type or F4 Manifestation Singleton (most prominently, information about the title) can be inferred to also apply to that instance of F2 Expression, no matter within which manifestation it is embodied.
The reasoning behind is that the Work title is known through the title of an Expression that is deemed representative of the Work, and the title of the representative Expression is known through the title proper of a Manifestation that is deemed representative of the Expression representative of the Work.

	<rdfs:comment>This class comprises activities through which an Agency declares (implicitly or explicitly) that a given instance of F2 Expression is representative for a given F15 Complex Work, i.e., that some attributes of that instance of F2 Expression (most prominently, information about the title) can be inferred to also apply to that instance of F15 Complex Work, no matter in which particular expression it is realised.
The reasoning behind this is that the Work title is known through the title of an Expression that is deemed representative of the Work, and the title of the representative Expression is known through the title of a Manifestation that is deemed representative of the Expression that is representative of the Work.
For instance, by using the qualified controlled access point ‘Poe, Edgar Allan, 1809-1849. Murders in the rue Morgue (French)’ for the French rendition of Poe’s ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’ by Baudelaire, an Agency implicitly states that the French text does not constitute a representative F2 Expression for Poe’s F1 Work, however the original English text does constitute a representative F2 Expression for Poe’s F1 Work.

The activity of creating such descriptions implies that one has to make decisions (as to the controlled access point for a work, as to whether an arrangement still belongs to the same work or is definitely a new work, etc.). Since such decisions always are debatable and different agencies can make different decisions about the same real-world entities, it is important to document which agency made which decision.

F50 Controlled Access Point covers the notion of both “preferred” and “variant” forms. It does not cover the notion of “cross references”. A cross reference may not uniquely identify one entity, but can be shared by two or more entities, regardless of whether it displays the same structural characteristics as preferred controlled access points.

<rdf:Property rdf:about="CLR6_should_carry">
	<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">should carry</rdfs:label>
	<rdfs:comment>This property associates a publication, i.e. an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type, with an instance of F24 Publication Expression, which all exemplars of that publication should carry, as long as they are recognised as complete exemplars of that publication. Typically, this property is observed on one exemplar of a publication, and extrapolated to all other exemplars of the same publication. This logical inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F3 Manifestation Product Type R7i has example F5 Item R6 carries F24 Publication Expression.
It can happen that a given exemplar, or a subset of exemplars, originally produced, or intended to be produced with that characteristic, accidentally lacks part of the publication expression. This fact should be recorded as a property of F5 Item, and not of F3 Manifestation Product Type.

	<rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression with an instance of F1 Work.
This property expresses the association that exists between an expression (F22) and the work that this expression conveys. The semantics of the association will be different depending on what specific subtype of F1 Work the work is an instance of. If the work is an instance of F14 Individual Work, the F22 Self-Contained Expression completely conveys the individual work. If the work is an instance of F15 Complex Work, the F22 Self-Contained Expression conveys an alternative member of the complex work.
Our factual knowledge of how a given work is realised into an expression is often limited and this property makes it possible to express the association between instances of F22 Self-Contained Expression and the work it conveys without using the more developed paths.
The property R3.1 has type: E55 Type allows for specifying the role played by the referred to expression in the overall bibliographic history of the work (e.g., ‘progenitor expression’, on which all other expressions of the same work are based; ‘reference for canonical citations’, in the sense of the HuCit ontology developed by Matteo Romanello and Michele Pasin; ‘earliest draft’, ‘intermediate draft’, ‘final clean draft’, ‘princeps edition’, etc.).

	<rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of E84 Information Carrier which is a reproduction of another instance of E84 Information Carrier with the latter. It is considered that a reproduction of multiple originals resulting in a single product requires a merging of those objects prior to the reproduction. Therefore an Information Carrier is regarded to be a reproduction of one and only one original. This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E84 Information Carrier through R30 produced (was produced by), F33 Reproduction Event R29 reproduced (was reproduced by) to E84 Information Carrier.

	<rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of F12 Nomen with one or more equivalent serialized content models for it. In digital form the symbol arrangement constituting an instance of F12 Nomen can only be represented through a particular encoding, for example ASCII or Latin1 for the Latin script. We call such a representation a content model. The property R33.1 has encoding: E55 Type allows for specifying the encoding of a particular associated content model. Together with this specification, a content model allows for unambiguously defining a nomen independently from the encoding used for representing the content.

<rdf:Property rdf:about="R40_has_representative_expression">

	<rdfs:comment>This property identifies an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression that has been chosen as the most characteristic expression of the instance of F1 Work of which it is an expression. There is no other semantic implication to this notion of being characteristic than to be an adequate candidate to uniquely identify the Work realized by it. Prototypically, this is the instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression that is deemed characteristic of an instance of F15 Complex Work.
Typically, any expression that is not regarded as “representative” for the work it expresses, would require a controlled access point, with qualifiers specifying the differences between that expression and a representative expression, although this may not always be done in practice. The title of a Work may not be one taken from a representative expression.
A given work can have more than one representative expression, provided the differences between these expressions are not deemed “substantial.” If the anticipated needs of users are not considered to call for bibliographic distinctions between variant expressions of a work, then even expressions that differ significantly from each other can be regarded as equally representative for the work. (See FRBR: Final Report, p. 19-20).
A given expression can be deemed representative for a work with regard to some of its aspects (e.g., the text contained in an edition the title proper of which reads ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’, and the language of that text), and not representative for it with regard to some other aspects (e.g., the title proper ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’ itself, which, being different from the title that is regarded as “representative” for Shakespeare’s work, will require the use of a controlled access point).
R40 has representative expression is a shortcut of the more developed path F1 Work R50i was assigned by F42 Representative Expression Assignment R51 assigned F2 Expression.

<rdf:Property rdf:about="R66_included_performed_version_of">

	<rdfs:comment>This property associates an instance of F31 Performance with a product of the mind that was performed in the course of that instance of F31 Performance.
According to the level of knowledge available about the performance, the range of this property can actually be specialised as either an instance of F1 Work (if nothing is known as to which specific expression of the work was performed), or of F2 Expression (if there is a reasonable amount of certainty as to which specific expression—e.g., a well identified translation of a play—of the work was performed).
In addition to being a subproperty of P16 used specific object (was used for), this property also is a shortcut of the fully developed path that goes from F31 Performance to F1 Work through: R25 performed F25 Performance Plan P165 incorporates F22 Self-Contained Expression R3i realises. In this fully developed path, the specific instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression can be precisely identified and described for its own sake, or it can just be known to have necessarily existed.
